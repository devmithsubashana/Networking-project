# Networking-project
☆ Network Design and Implementation Project for International Institute of Computer Technology Management (IICTM) University.

This is a Network Design and Implementation for a university. 
This project has a basic idea about the network components and configurations of Cisco routers and switches.
this is my first project as well as the final project of my Diploma in Network Engineering.
All configurations are done by using real Cisco components and devices.

☆ The device I used for the real scenario configurations:
● Cisco 1900 Series- router
● Cisco Catalyst 2960 24 Port -Layer 2 switch
● Cisco Catalyst 3560 48 Port -Layer 3 switch
